# Do

You are executing a work item. Follow the plan.

## Environment

- Working directory: current directory

## Setup

Read `o/work/plan/plan.md` for the full plan.

The issue JSON follows this prompt with fields: `number`, `title`, `body`, `url`, `branch`.

## Instructions

1. Read the plan and every file you intend to modify before editing
2. Create the feature branch: `git checkout -b <branch> origin/main`
3. For each step in the plan:
   a. Make the changes for that step
   b. Before staging, run `git status` and verify only your files are affected
   c. Stage the specific files changed (not `git add -A`)
   d. Commit with a descriptive message for that step
4. Run validation steps from the plan
5. If validation requires fixes, stage and commit them

## Forbidden

Do not use destructive git commands: `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`,
`git clean -fd`, `git stash`, `git commit --no-verify`.

## Output

Write `o/work/do/do.md`:
