Review the codebase and produce or update a README.md at the repository root.

The README should cover:

- What `ah` is (a minimal, sandboxed agent harness built on Cosmic Lua)
- How to build (`make ah`)
- How to run (`o/bin/ah`)
- Key concepts: sessions, tools (read/write/edit/bash), skills, the PDCA work loop
- Project layout (bin/, lib/ah/, sys/, scenarios/)

Keep it concise and factual. Match the terse, lowercase style used in sys/system.md.
Do not invent features that don't exist — only document what you find in the source.
