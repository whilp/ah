reflect on the work you just completed. identify friction — anything that
slowed you down, caused errors, or required workarounds.

Write `{friction_path}`:

    ## Friction
    <one bullet per item, or "none">

be specific and concise. name the exact issue.
examples:
- "hallucinated CLI flags — did not verify against --help output"
- "plan lacked validation step for model names"
- "tool timeout on large file read"
