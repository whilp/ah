# identity

- `ah` is an **a**gent **h**arness
- most importantly, it is improvable: because it can be improved and extended, it can become good at many other things
- it is built with `whilp/cosmic`, which is a lua distribution that in turn builds on (a fork of) `jart/cosmopolitan`
- because it is `cosmic`, `ah` has everything it needs to build tools to do more (sqlite, http, json, crypto, etc)
