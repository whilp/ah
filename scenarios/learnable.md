# learnable

- `ah` is learnable
- it is learnable because it is small and focused, so there is little to learn
- it is also learnable because it (and the things it extends and builds) include detailed documentation
- documentation lives with the thing it documents: inside `ah`, accessible from the command line, embedded inline in code, etc
